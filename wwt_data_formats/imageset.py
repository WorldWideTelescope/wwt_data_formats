    The parity of the image's projection on the sky.

    For untiled (``projection = SkyImage``) images, this flag defines the
    image's parity, which basically sets whether the image needs to be flipped
    during rendering. This field should be False for typical RGB color images
    that map onto the sky as if you had taken them with a digital camera. For
    these images, the first row of image data is at the top of the image at zero
    rotation. For typical FITS files, on the other hand, the first row of image
    data is at the bottom of the image, which results in a parity inversion. In
    these cases, the ``bottoms_up`` flag should be True (hence its name). In the
    terminology of `Astrometry.Net
    <https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astrometry_net/astrometry_net.html#parity>`_,
    ``bottoms_up = False`` corresponds to negative parity, and ``bottoms_up =
    True`` corresponds to positive parity.

    The effect of setting this flag to True is to effectively flip the image and
    its coordinate system left-to-right. For a ``bottoms_up = False`` image with
    :attr:`offset_x`, :attr:`offset_y`, and :attr:`rotation_deg` all zero, the
    lower-left corner of the image lands at the :attr:`center_x` and
    :attr:`center_y`, and positive rotations rotate the image counter-clockwise
    around that origin. If you take the same image and make ``bottoms_up =
    True``, the image will appear to have been flipped left-to-right, the
    lower-*right* corner of the image will land at the coordinate center, and
    positive rotations will rotate it *clockwise* around that origin. In both
    cases, positive values of :attr:`offset_x` and :attr:`offset_y` move the
    center of the image closer to the coordinate center, but when ``bottoms_up =
    False``, this means that the image is moving down and left, and when
    ``bottoms_up = True`` this means that the image is moving down and right.

    For tiled images (``projection = Tan``), this field must be false. If it is
    true, the imageset won't render.

        -----
        Certain of the ImageSet parameters take on different meanings depending
        on whether the image in question is a tiled "study" or not. This method
        will alter its behavior depending on whether the :attr:`tile_levels`
        attribute is greater than zero. **Make sure that this parameter has
        acquired its final value before calling this function.**

        For the time being, the WCS must be equatorial using the gnomonic
        (``TAN``) projection.

        Required keywords in *headers* are:

        - ``CTYPE1`` and ``CTYPE2``
        - ``CRVAL1`` and ``CRVAL2``
        - ``CRPIX1`` and ``CRPIX2``
        - Either:
            - ``CD1_1``, ``CD2_2`` (preferred)
            - ``CDELT1``, ``CDELT2``, ``PC1_1``, and ``PC1_2``; or

        If present ``PC1_2``, ``PC2_1``, ``CD1_2``, and/or ``CD2_1`` are used.
        If absent, they are assumed to be zero.

        This routine assumes that the WCS coordinates have the correct parity
        for the data that they describe. If these WCS coordinates describe a
        JPEG-like image, the parity of the coordinates should be negative
        ("top-down"), which means that the determinant of the CD matrix should
        have a *positive* sign. If these coordinates describe a FITS-like image,
        the parity should be positive or "bottoms-up", with a negative
        determinant of the CD matrix. If the image in question is tiled, the
        parity must be top-down, in the sense the bottoms-up tiled imagery just
        won't render in the engine. There are some CD matrices that can't be
        expressed in WWT's formalism (rotation, scale, parity) and this method
        will do its best to detect and reject them.

        At the moment, this function only works for ImageSets with a projection

        later, if the need arises. Note, however, that tiled images have their
        sizes adjusted to be powers of 2, and the "actual" size of the source
        imagery is not necessarily preserved.
