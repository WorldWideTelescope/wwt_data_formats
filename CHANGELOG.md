# wwt_data_formats 0.10.3 (2021-09-15)

- Fix verification of WCS rotations near 45 degrees (#41, @pkgw). This should
  allow processing of some astrometry that was being rejected even though it's
  fine.


# wwt_data_formats 0.10.2 (2021-09-08)

- Fix vertical positioning of tiled images (#40, @pkgw). Building on the bigger
  WCS changes, we believe that there was a problem in how WCS data were
  converted into WWT's format for tiled images when there reference pixel was
  not close to the image center. Empirically this seems to be behaving well with
  the test cases that triggered the discovery of this issue, but this seems like
  something that should have been caught sooner â€” keep an eye out for issues!


# wwt_data_formats 0.10.1 (2021-08-06)

- No code changes from 0.10.0. There was an issue that broke our automated
  publication to PyPI (#38, @pkgw). This should now be fixed, so let's issue
  a new release.


# wwt_data_formats 0.10.0 (2021-08-06)

- This release features major improvements to the WCS handling, especially with
  regards to image "parity". While the theoretical way to think about parity
  involves the transformation between the image-pixel coordinate system and the
  sky coordinate system, the practical way is to compare FITS and JPEG files --
  the Y=0 row of a FITS file is at the bottom of the image, while it's at the
  *top* in JPEG files. WCS coordinates can express either parity, but we weren't
  handling them properly. Until now. Our WCS interfaces now deal with
  coordinates more carefully and pay attention to the parity options, which are
  expressed in the "BottomsUp" field of an imageset on the WWT side. This is a
  **breaking** change in practice because this library's handling of the same
  WCS input may change substantially depending on whether you're running a
  version <= 0.9 or not. (#36, #37, @pkgw)


# wwt_data_formats 0.9.2 (2021-06-14)

- Work around an issue in the documentation toolchain that caused
  many class fields to be lost in the final output (@pkgw, #35)
- Fix `fetch_folder_tree` to not crash in the (default) case where
  `on_fetch = None` (@Carifio24, #34)


# wwt_data_formats 0.9.1 (2021-02-09)

- Start supporting glob arguments on Windows. It turns out that you have
  to implement this manually.


# wwt_data_formats 0.9.0 (2021-02-04)

- Add `wwtdatatool wtml transfer-astrometry` for helping transfer refined
  astrometry between different WTML variants.
- Remove CLI foo from the API docs


# wwt_data_formats 0.8.0 (2020-12-05)

- Add a `wwtdatatool preview` command, as suggested by @astrofrog.


# wwt_data_formats 0.7.0 (2020-12-03)

- Add a `wwtdatatool wtml report` command to report on the metadata contents
  of single-dataset WTML files. This is a bit of a hack intended for use in
  Toasty pipelines, but it might become more general.
- Improve support for open-ended annotation attributes in datasets.
  Specifically, add `Annotation` and `Description` in places, and note that
  `Description` in ImageSets isn't wired up in the apps and so should be
  avoided.
- Fix calculation of image centers when setting up WWT metadata based on a
  WCS data structure. I had the X and Y swapped, like a chump.


# wwt_data_formats 0.6.0 (2020-11-17)

- Add `wwtdatatool wtml rewrite-disk` to transform a "relative" WTML file to one
  containing on-disk file paths, to ease testing with the Windows desktop app.
- Fix XML files created on Windows to be sure that they specify UTF-8 encoding,
  not CP-1252.


# wwt_data_formats 0.5.0 (2020-10-12)

- Add a `wwtdatatool wtml merge` subcommand to ease the creation of "index" WTML
  files from single-dataset WTMLs.


# wwt_data_formats 0.4.6 (2020-10-05)

- Try to always read and write files with UTF-8 encoding, accepting Windows Byte
  Order Markers (BOMs) when present.


# wwt_data_formats 0.4.5 (2020-10-01)

- Wire up the AltUrl property of ImageSets
- In the CLI, group WTML tree commands under `tree` subcommand
- Report AltUrls in `tree print-image-urls`
- Add `tree print-dem-urls`


# wwt_data_formats 0.4.4 (2020-09-28)

- Still no code changes from 0.4.2-0.4.3. Attempting to fix automated upload to
  PyPI.


# wwt_data_formats 0.4.3 (2020-09-28)

- No code changes from 0.4.2. Attempting to fix automated upload to PyPI.


# wwt_data_formats 0.4.2 (2020-09-28)

- Convert to Cranko for release automation! And Codecov.io for coverage
  reporting, and Azure Pipelines for CI.
- HTTP hacks to try to get the server test to succeed reliably on CI.


# 0.4.1 (2020-Sep-18)

- Fix the test suite on Windows (hopefully).


# 0.4.0 (2020-Sep-15)

- Add a bunch of CLI documentation.
- No code changes.


# 0.3.0 (2020-Jul-30)

- Add `wwtdatatool serve` to locally serve WTML files with on-the-fly URL
  rewriting.
- Add `wwtdatatool wtml rewrite-urls` to allow you to take a WTML file with
  relative URLs and convert them into absolute ones.
- `wwtdatatool cabinet unpack`: copy with cabinet files whose paths begin with a
  leading slash (as in the default WWT installer `datafiles.cabinet` file).
- In `wwt_data_formats.layers`, support WWTL files where the data assets are not
  necessarily placed in a subdirectory named for the layer ID (observed in the
  wild).
- In `wwt_data_formats.imageset`, copy with WCS PC matrices that have non-unity
  determinants (also observed in the wild).


# 0.2.0 (2020-Jun-17)

- Clarify that the `requests` package is now always required.
- Add `wwt_data_formats.layers` for dealing with WWTL layer-export files.


# 0.1.3 (2020-Jun-06)

- Add a CLI tool, `wwtdatatool`, to provide interfaces to certain low-level
  operations
- Add some infrastructure to support walking of trees of folders with on-the-fly
  downloads as needed.
- Support the Imageset::reference_frame attribute
- Support Communities metadata
- Fix the test suite for Python 3.8


# 0.1.2 (2020-Mar-20)

- Fix roundtripping of imagesets with a non-empty QuadTreeMap, and add a few
  more attributes on the `<ImageSet>` type.
- Fix loading of XML files missing attributes that we expected to see.
- Allow "Tangent" as an alias for "Tan" when deserializing ProjectionType
  enums.
- Add `to_xml_string()` and `write_xml()` convenience methods on the
  LockedXmlTraits class that's a base class for most of our data types.


# 0.1.1 (2020-Mar-17)

- Fix `wwt_data_formats.imageset.ImageSet.set_position_from_wcs()` for the new
  metadata scheme.


# 0.1.0 (2020-Mar-17)

- Massive infrastructure rebuild. We now use traitlets and have a framework
  for XML serialization, rather than a bunch of boilerplate code. We can
  now deserialize folders and their contents.


# 0.0.2 (2020-Feb-05)

- Document the FileCabinet support
- Work with FITS files that have `CDELT{1,2}` but not `PC1_1` and `PC2_2`.
- Removed Python 2.7 from the CI.


# 0.0.1 (2019-Dec-04)

- First version
